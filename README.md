phele apn waterfall methods krte hai . kyoki changes software mai itne frequent nhi aya krte the . abhi softwareneed to nbe updated in some lesser period of time so that you will update everthing which is available.
waterfall model -- requirement gathering->software design->code->testing->delivery and deployment->maintenance.
disadvantages -> make changes difficult . not end user oriented . testing delayed .

what is agile  ----> changes need do be done
it enables team to deliver value to custonmers . work in small and usable increments , changes are made quickly


               "agile manisfesto -
 =>  individual and interaction over process tools
=>working produvt over documentation
=>customer collabaration over negosiation
=>respond challenges over following a plan "

agile principle ---->customer satisfaction should be there   , give them something
             ------> welcome changes
             ------->Deliver Frequently
             ------->work together
             ------->Motivated team
             ------->Face-to-face interaction
             -------->working software
             -------->Constant pace
             -------->good design
             -------->simplicity
             -------->self-organization
             -------->Reflet and adjust
             12 principle

advantages  -----> large amount of interaction team and client , improved transparency , the delivery is predicted    , cost of the project is predictable
it allows for changes priotize product backlogs , priority of the features , focusing of users , broken in small units.

---- agile methodologies  ----- Extreme programming xp -- it is a framework that enable high equality software and improves life where is applicable ---- where software changes, where small tems is there , to handle risks caused due to new technology , to use tech, to allow automated unit and functional tests
------------------------------> kanban -- this is the methodology to design and manage and improve the flow of the systems , organization can visualise their work in progess . time constanit
------------------------------> lean---- it a tools and principle that aims to identify and remove that aims to identify and remove waste to increase the speed of the process development . waste should be less.
------------------------------> scrum  -------scrum is framework that is used by tems to establish a hypothesis try it out, reflet the experience and adjust, it is used to enable temas to incorpartae practices from other framework depending on the team.s requirements , sprits,backlogs , whenapplicable  sprits 2-4 weeks iterations
------------------------------> crystal --- crystal ia an aproach that focus people and interactions it works on the unique and dynamic projects.

what is scrum  ----------------> for example---customer doesnot like the project so what to do ...
scrum kese help krega  ----- agile is iteractive metholodies.

framework where teams work together -- learn from experiences, in time , time and money use defficiently , smaller units called sprints , scrum meetings what some guy done today . feedback by customer making changes is easy , individual efforts are important
scurm team - product owner,scrum master,scrum team   PO->ROI maximum  SM- works with the team, skill and process sb yhi dekhta hai.ST. ye sb krte hai...
artifacts-----product backlog,sprint backlog, product increment


scrum framework  - product backlog next sprint planning next sprint backlog next scrum team daily scrum  next sprint review and sprint resprective next product backlog next increment
scrum bozrd --- it helps us to tracking viusal

weather master ---- Direction is given by him  puri backchodi karo pure time ... kya kiya aaj

Agile project management  --------->>> agile project management is divided into small parts to be done on some daily basis

Each sprint consist of planning designing Testing and release mini project is delivered ,  high equality product , reduce risk, owner know what is product ,
principle managemnet - satisfication , time interval is short in delivery,management and develpers can work together, stackholder can change anytime, trust, cordination,face-to-face communication, finding solution,scrum tools should be integreated
project planning,roadmap creation,release planning,sprint planning,daily meetings,sprint review and restropective
frames=========> kanban framework kanban board..... scrum framework advanced technoloy   ===> hybrid framework => both of before last is lean
companies=======> ibm,cisco,phillips, and samsungs,


User Stories     ====> it is a tool where we know what user is wanting in end.
Like Hr software there functional requirement , some feature and there interface. end user and internal users. Building blocks, epic combination of differnt users.users role are discussed,iteractive development
Investing in user stories....can be modification & negoziation, valuable ,estimable , small , testable ,
how to user stories   --- as a role i want to  so that
for example  --- as a ceo i want to track my subordinates progrss,to ensure the organization goals are met
card,conversation,confirmation
lifecycle ====> pending=>todo=>discussion=> developing=>confirmation=>finished
user value


scaled agole framework safe ==> large scale project , alignment is important

frameworks to scale aguile - less large scale scrum , safe,dad disiplined agile,nexus scrum,spotify model,scrum at scale
safe core values ---> alogmnet , built in quality , transparency , program execution,
compenties --> team and technical agilility ,

safe advantages ===>  agile and scrum differnce
